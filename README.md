# Data Analysis and Practical Statistics
### Project Description
 This is a project for the Udacity course Intro to Data Analysis and Practical Statistics. It is made up of 2 parts. The first is contained in the Investigate_a_Dataset notebook. The second being found in the Analyze_AB_Test_Results notebook.  
### Environment(s)
Jupyter Notebook
### Language(s)
Python
### Packages and Libraries
pandas  
matplotlib  
numpy  
statsmodels
### Competencies
1. Foundations of Data Science: Describe the foundations of data science.
2. Data Wrangling: Create a data set that is usable for aanalysis by applying data wrangling tachniques.
3. Statistical Techniques: Incorporate statistical techniques to assist with parametric, nonparametric, and linear regression analyses.
### Part I
Investigate a Dataset: Using the tmdb-movies database, we will answer the question of which attributes correlate more closely to higher revenues. Multiple methods and visualizations are used to explore and analyze the data.
### Part II
Analyze A/B Test Results: Using probability, A/B testing, and regression we will investigate a dataset to analyze a companies usage of a new landing page.
